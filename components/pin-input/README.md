# PIN Input Components Security Implementation

## Security Architecture

The PIN security system has been consolidated to reduce duplication and improve maintainability:

### Component Layer
- **PinInputField/PinInputModal**: User interface components for PIN entry
- Uses IoC pattern to minimize PIN storage and movement between components

### Security Layer (Consolidated)
- **pin-security.ts**: Single source of truth for PIN security operations
  - PIN hashing with proper salt and iterations
  - Constant-time PIN comparison to prevent timing attacks
  - PIN format validation
  - PIN-based encryption/decryption coordination
  - Secure PIN processing with memory clearing

- **PinProcessor**: (Deprecated - for backward compatibility only)
  - Now re-exports from pin-security.ts
  - Will be removed in a future version

### Cryptographic Layer
- **crypto.ts**: Low-level encryption/decryption operations
  - AES-GCM encryption for data security
  - PBKDF2 key derivation from PIN
  - Secure random generation

### Storage Layer
- **secure-store.ts**: Handles persistent secure storage
  - Manages encrypted data storage using Expo SecureStore
  - Never stores raw PINs, only securely hashed values

## Current Implementation

The implementation has been improved to enhance security:

1. **Consolidated Security Logic**:
   - Moved all PIN handling to pin-security.ts
   - Eliminated duplication between files
   - Single source of truth for PIN operations

2. **Improved IoC Implementation**:
   - Consistent use of processWithPin across all PIN operations
   - Standardized approach to PIN memory management

3. **Better Maintainability**:
   - Clear separation between UI components and security logic
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Clearer ownership of security responsibilities

## Migration Path

To update existing code:
1. Replace `PinProcessor.verifyPin` with `verifyStoredPin` from pin-security.ts
2. Replace `PinProcessor.encryptWithPin` with `secureEncryptWithPin` from pin-security.ts
3. Replace `PinProcessor.decryptWithPin` with `secureDecryptWithPin` from pin-security.ts

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1 (Current)
- Consolidated PIN security logic into pin-security.ts
- Maintained backward compatibility through PinProcessor
- Improved documentation and migration guidance

### Phase 2
- Remove PinProcessor completely
- Implement full IoC pattern through all PIN-handling components
- Add timeouts for automatic PIN clearing

### Phase 3
- Migrate to per-digit PIN input for enhanced security
- Implement Context API for secure digit collection
- Explore WebAssembly for sensitive cryptographic operations
