# Mnemonic Security Audit

Date: 2025-08-14
Branch: release-1.0
Scope: Review of repository code paths that could lead to exposure or exfiltration of a user's mnemonic ("recovery phrase") or enable a sophisticated attack to extract it.

## ⚠️ Implementation Update (2025-08-14)

**Key Derivation Algorithm Change**: This audit originally recommended Argon2id implementation. Based on implementation considerations and library availability, **the final implementation uses Scrypt via @noble/hashes** instead of Argon2. Scrypt provides equivalent memory-hard security properties while offering:

- ✅ **Excellent JavaScript implementation** in @noble/hashes (audited and maintained)
- ✅ **No native module required** (faster deployment)
- ✅ **Memory-hard properties** (GPU/ASIC resistant like Argon2)
- ✅ **RFC 7914 standard compliance**

References to "Argon2" in this document should be understood as applying to the Scrypt implementation with equivalent security parameters.

## Executive Summary
Overall design: Mnemonics are stored (per account) encrypted under a 6‑digit PIN-derived key using PBKDF2(SHA-256, 10k iter, static salt) + AES-GCM (via @noble/ciphers). Storage backend is `expo-secure-store`. Retrieval requires correct PIN verification against a hashed record, then decryption, optionally gated by a "reveal scheduling" delay. Major risks center on (1) low entropy of a fixed-length numeric PIN (brute force), (2) static global salt enabling offline cracking if ciphertext & PIN hash leak, (3) potential enumeration of account keys with predictable naming, (4) insufficient anti-bruteforce / rate limiting, (5) logging & memory lifetime issues, (6) integrity token being static and increasing oracle quality, (7) lack of secure hardware binding / per-device key wrapping, (8) reveal scheduling logic enforceable only client-side, and (9) possible downgrade / replay if attacker controls local storage. Below are detailed findings and recommendations.

Risk rating legend: High – practical path to mnemonic compromise with moderate attacker capability. Medium – increases likelihood given additional conditions. Low – theoretical or requires powerful attacker (e.g., runtime compromise) but still improvable.

## Post-Implementation Verification (2025-08-14)
This follow-up review compared the "Phase 1 COMPLETED" claims in this document against the current `refector-security-phase-one` branch code.

Summary:
| Item | Claimed Status | Actual Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Switch to memory-hard KDF (Scrypt / Argon2 replacement) | Completed | Completed | `PBKDF2` code absent; Scrypt used for PIN hashing & encryption key derivation with per-record salt. |
| Per-record salt for ciphertext | Completed | Completed | Salt (16 bytes) prefixed to each ciphertext. |
| Storage key obfuscation (global) | Completed | Partial | `use-secure-storage` migrates; other code paths (`use-transaction-pin.ts`, `pin-rotation.ts`, `account-deletion.ts`) still use `account_<id>`. |
| Rate limiting / lockout | Completed | Completed (baseline) | Exponential backoff implemented; max lockout 5 min – could be extended. |
| Removal of static integrity token | Completed | Completed | AES-GCM tag only. |
| Increased PIN complexity (6–12 alphanumeric) | Completed | Not Implemented | `validatePinFormat` still enforces exactly 6 digits (`/^\d{6}$/`). |
| Production logging controls | Completed | Partial | Numerous `console.log/warn` remain without production gating. |
| Clipboard management / scrubbing | Completed | Unverified / Likely Not Implemented | No clipboard handling logic located in reviewed files. |
| Ciphertext versioning | (Not listed) | Not Implemented | No version header; format is raw `salt|nonce|ciphertext`. |
| Universal obfuscation of metadata keys (`user_pin`, attempts) | (Not listed) | Not Implemented | Keys remain predictable. |
| Key material zeroization | (Not listed) | Not Implemented | Derived `keyBytes` not cleared. |

Outstanding High/Medium Issues:
1. Fixed-length 6-digit PIN (low entropy) despite stronger KDF.
2. Partial key obfuscation leaves predictable paths to encrypted mnemonics.
3. No ciphertext versioning impedes future migrations.
4. Predictable meta keys (`user_pin`, attempt record) & key index enumeration.
5. Logging not consistently gated.
6. No device / hardware binding layer yet.

Recommended Immediate Remediation Priority (updated):
1. Unify key obfuscation across all code paths (eliminate direct `account_<id>` usages).
2. Add ciphertext version header + legacy detection/migration path.
3. Expand PIN policy (optional longer / alphanumeric) with migration UX.
4. Normalize decrypt failure responses (avoid `{verified:false}` oracle) & introduce key zeroization.
5. Gate or strip sensitive logs in production build.

Residual risk analysis in later sections should be read with these corrections in mind.

## Findings

### 1. Weak Secret Derivation From 6-Digit PIN (High)
- PIN format enforced by `validatePin` is exactly 6 digits (1e6 possibilities). With PBKDF2 10k iterations, an offline attacker can brute force quickly on commodity hardware (≈ <1s for million PBKDF2(10k) with optimized native code / GPU).
- Successful offline scenario: Attacker obtains `user_pin` (salt+hash) plus an encrypted mnemonic (ciphertext) from SecureStore backup / device compromise.
- Result: PIN and mnemonic recoverable. Numeric PIN provides minimal entropy.

Recommendation: Require higher-entropy passphrase (e.g., 8+ digits or alphanumeric), allow optional biometric-gated hardware key, or add a per-account high-entropy random key (wrapped by PIN-derived key) so mnemonic encryption isn't directly brute forced from PIN alone. Increase PBKDF2 iterations (>=100k) and/or switch to Scrypt (via @noble/hashes) for memory-hard key derivation.

### 2. Static Global Salt For Encryption Key Derivation (High)
- In `crypto.ts`, SALT = stringToUint8Array("WalletAppSalt123456") is constant and shared across all users. This enables building rainbow tables for all PINs across the user base.
- A unique per-user (per PIN) salt is only applied for PIN hash in `pin-security.ts` but not for encryption key derivation.

Recommendation: Generate and store a per-account random salt alongside the encrypted mnemonic (e.g., prefix ciphertext with salt+nonce). Derive key with that salt. Maintain backward migration logic.

### 3. Lack of Rate Limiting / Attempt Throttling (High)
- Functions `verifyStoredPin` and `secureDecryptWithPin` impose no retry delay. An attacker with interactive access (malicious automation / overlay attack) can brute force PIN online rapidly.

Recommendation: Maintain PIN failure counters in secure storage; exponential backoff (e.g., 5 failures -> 30s, 10 -> 5m, 15 -> wipe or escalate). Consider device-level biometric requirement after N failures.

### 4. Predictable Storage Key Names (Medium)
- Keys use template `account_${accountId}`. If attacker gains partial SecureStore access (e.g., due to misconfiguration or multi-app environment), enumeration is trivial. Disclosure of encrypted blob + static SALT hastens brute force.

Recommendation: Obfuscate key names (hash(accountId || randomPerInstall) prefix). Store a mapping table encrypted under device key.

### 5. Integrity Token Design (Medium)
- Integrity token `VALID_DECRYPTION_TOKEN_123` appended in clear (post-decrypt) is static. Wrong PIN decrypt attempts give oracle: if token absent, treat as invalid; an attacker can test candidate PINs offline by re-running PBKDF2+decrypt and checking delimiter + token. This speeds brute-force (no padding ambiguity). Not catastrophic, but increases feasibility.

Recommendation: Use AES-GCM auth tag only (already provides integrity) and remove custom token. To detect wrong PIN, rely on GCM failure (catch). Present generic error.

### 6. Returning Structured Feedback on Decryption (Medium)
- `decryptWithPin` returns `{ verified: false }` vs null; differences in timing / branching could yield side-channel. Combined with immediate error messaging, an online attacker receives high-quality oracle.

Recommendation: Normalize responses: always constant-time path; return generic error on failure without specifying correctness vs corruption.

### 7. Exposure via Logging (Medium)
- Numerous `console.log` statements around sensitive flows (e.g., success states, failure reasons). While mnemonic itself isn't logged, timestamps and actions can assist attacker behavior analysis, and in compromised builds, additional logging could be injected.

Recommendation: Remove or gate logs behind development flag; ensure production build strips debug logs.

### 8. No Memory Hardening / Wiping (Low)
- JavaScript limitations acknowledged. However, mnemonic strings kept in React state (`RecoveryState.mnemonic`, `useSecureStorage.value`, etc.) persist until reset. After reveal, value lives up to 30s in memory (auto-hide). A runtime memory dump (e.g., via compromised device / debugger) can capture it.

Recommendation: Upon reveal display, render from a transient buffer and immediately overwrite state after handoff to view layer (e.g., show component that fetches on demand). Reduce auto-hide window (e.g., 10s) and add manual copy-only view with ephemeral buffer.

### 9. Client-Side Only Reveal-Scheduling Security (Low/Bypassable)
- Reveal scheduling logic (`reveal-controller.ts`) uses local timestamps; a user or malware can modify device clock or local storage to bypass waiting period. Not a confidentiality issue if PIN enforced, but reduces defense in depth against rapid shoulder-surf exposures.

Recommendation: Treat scheduling purely UX; if security intent, move to server-side or use monotonic timers backed by secure enclave / trusted attestation (not currently feasible in pure Expo). Document limitation.

### 10. Missing Device Binding / Hardware Keystore (Medium)
- Encryption key derivation not bound to device secrets. Exfiltrated secure store blob + PIN hash can be brute forced off-device.

Recommendation: Use platform Keychain / Android Keystore with per-install random master key to wrap mnemonic encryption key; or derive KEK = HKDF(deviceHardwareKey, userSalt) then wrap content key.

### 11. Potential Replay / Rollback Attack (Low)
- No versioning or MAC over metadata. Attacker could replace ciphertext with older one (still valid GCM tag). User may sign with outdated mnemonic if key rotation planned.

Recommendation: Include version + random salt in envelope: {version, salt, nonce, ciphertext, tag}. On decrypt validate version; optionally store last nonce to detect rollback (needs secure monotonic counter or anchor).

### 12. Key Rotation Complexity (Low)
- `pin-rotation.ts` (reviewed partially via grep) re-encrypts data. If interrupted mid-rotation, may leave some items under old PIN; no atomic commit or backup. Could create confusion or partial failure enabling downgrade.

Recommendation: Write new records with suffix, verify, then swap pointer; maintain rotation journal state to resume or rollback.

### 13. Enumeration of All Secure Keys (Low)
- `updateKeysList` maintains `all_storage_keys`. Compromise of that list increases attack surface enumeration.

Recommendation: Encrypt the key index or derive list at runtime from encrypted metadata.

### 14. Static Nonce Reuse Risk (Currently Mitigated) (Info)
- Nonces are random via `getRandomBytes(12)`; confirm `getRandomBytes` uses crypto.getRandomValues. Ensure no deterministic reuse; review `random.ts` (not yet audited here). If weak RNG, GCM catastrophic.

Action: Audit `random.ts` to ensure cryptographically secure randomness.

### 15. Lack of In-App Clipboard Scrubbing (Medium UX / Potential Leak)
- If user copies mnemonic (assuming a copy feature exists elsewhere), no shown logic scrubs clipboard. Native clipboard can leak to other apps / system logs.

Recommendation: Add controlled copy with immediate scrub (after timeout) and explicit warning; on iOS 16+ avoid background pasteboard reads.

### 16. PIN Hash Storage Key Naming (Low)
- `user_pin` key stores JSON (salt, hash, iterations). Predictable; attacker immediately identifies it.

Recommendation: Obfuscate key; store alongside other metadata under single encrypted blob.

### 17. No Screen Overlay / Screenshot Protection (Platform-Specific) (Low)
- Not addressed in code: On Android, FLAG_SECURE not set (RN config). Mnemonic reveal screen may be screenshot or appear in app switcher.

Recommendation: Add native module / config to enable secure window flag and blur app switcher previews.

## Attack Scenarios

1. Device File Extraction + Offline Brute Force:
   - Attacker extracts SecureStore data (rooted device or backup) containing encrypted mnemonic and `user_pin` hash. Uses static salt for encryption + per-hash salt to brute force 1M PINs swiftly, recovers mnemonic.
2. Malicious Automation (On-Device):
   - Malware injects UI events, rapidly tries PIN guesses (no lockout) until success, decrypts mnemonic and exfiltrates.
3. Overlay Phishing:
   - Fake PIN modal harvests user PIN; attacker reads stored ciphertext and decrypts offline.
4. Clock Manipulation:
   - User toggles system clock to bypass reveal wait; not direct exfiltration but reduces friction for local shoulder-surf attack.

## Migration Sketch for Enhanced Security

### Per-Entry Salt + Scrypt Migration
1. **New ciphertext format** (base64 of JSON):
   ```json
   {
     "v": 3,
     "alg": "scrypt",
     "s": "<b64salt>",
     "n": "<b64nonce>",
     "c": "<b64cipher>",
     "p": {"t":2, "m":65536, "p":1}
   }
   ```
2. **Backward compatibility**: Detect legacy formats (v1: binary, v2: JSON with PBKDF2)
3. **Lazy migration**: On decrypt, if legacy format detected:
   - Decrypt using old algorithm
   - Re-encrypt with Scrypt + new format
   - Delete old entry atomically
4. **Scrypt implementation**: Use @noble/hashes for JavaScript-optimized performance and security
5. **Configuration validation**: Ensure parameters meet security requirements per device capability

### Hardware Keystore Integration
1. **Device master key generation**:
   ```typescript
   // One-time setup per app installation
   const deviceKey = await SecureStore.setItemAsync('device_master_key',
     uint8ArrayToBase64(getRandomBytes(32)), {
       requireAuthentication: true,
       authenticationPrompt: 'Set up wallet security'
     });
   ```
2. **Key wrapping workflow**:
   ```typescript
   // Wrap data encryption key with hardware key
   const dataKey = getRandomBytes(32);
   const wrappedKey = await aesGcmEncrypt(dataKey, deviceMasterKey);
   const encryptedData = await aesGcmEncrypt(mnemonic, dataKey);
   ```
3. **Biometric authentication integration**:
   ```typescript
   // Require biometrics for sensitive operations
   const authResult = await LocalAuthentication.authenticateAsync({
     promptMessage: 'Authenticate to access wallet',
     requireConfirmation: true,
     disableDeviceFallback: false
   });
   ```

### Progressive Enhancement Strategy
- **Phase 1**: All new encryptions use Scrypt + per-record salt
- **Phase 2**: Existing data migrated on first access
- **Phase 3**: Hardware wrapping applied to all encryption keys
- **Phase 4**: TEE operations for critical functions

## Testing & Verification Additions

### Cryptographic Function Tests
- **Scrypt implementation validation**: Verify memory usage, timing consistency, cross-platform compatibility
- **Hardware keystore integration**: Test biometric flows, device binding, fallback scenarios
- **Migration logic verification**: Test legacy format detection and conversion accuracy
- **Performance benchmarking**: Ensure Scrypt parameters meet usability requirements (<200ms)

### Security Property Tests
- **Brute force protection**: Verify rate limiting lockout scenarios and exponential backoff
- **Nonce uniqueness validation**: Property test ensuring no two encrypt operations produce identical ciphertext for same input
- **Timing consistency verification**: Rough timing test to ensure failures are standardized (mock timers/logs)
- **Memory clearing validation**: Test that sensitive data cleanup occurs as expected
- **Hardware key protection**: Verify keys cannot be extracted without biometric authentication

### Attack Simulation Tests
- **Offline brute force simulation**: Measure actual attack cost with new Scrypt parameters
- **Device binding validation**: Verify encrypted data cannot be used on different devices
- **PIN attempt exhaustion**: Test lockout behavior and recovery mechanisms
- **Migration safety**: Ensure no data loss during algorithm transitions
- **Biometric bypass attempts**: Test fallback scenarios and security boundaries

### Platform-Specific Tests
- **iOS Secure Enclave integration**: Verify key generation and protection in hardware
- **Android Keystore validation**: Test StrongBox availability and fallback behavior
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Ensure data encrypted on one platform can be decrypted on another
- **Device capability detection**: Test graceful degradation on older hardware

## Residual Risks
Even with improvements, a fully compromised device (rooted with debugger) can usually extract mnemonics eventually. Defense in depth reduces exposure window and increases attack cost.

## Scrypt vs AES: Complementary Security Functions

### Why Both Scrypt AND AES Are Required

**Scrypt** and **AES** serve fundamentally different purposes in cryptographic security and are **complementary, not alternatives**:

#### Scrypt: Key Derivation Function (KDF)
- **Purpose**: Transforms low-entropy inputs (PINs) into high-entropy cryptographic keys
- **Security Goal**: Resist brute force attacks through computational cost
- **Function**: `PIN + Salt → Cryptographic Key`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Memory-hard (requires significant RAM)
  - Time-consuming (tunable computational cost)
  - Produces fixed-size output (32 bytes for AES-256)

#### AES: Symmetric Encryption Algorithm
- **Purpose**: Encrypts/decrypts actual data using cryptographic keys
- **Security Goal**: Provide confidentiality and integrity for stored data
- **Function**: `Data + Key → Encrypted Data`
- **Characteristics**:
  - Fast symmetric encryption
  - Authenticated encryption (AES-GCM)
  - Industry standard for data protection

### Current Architecture (PBKDF2 + AES)
```typescript
// Current flow:
PIN → PBKDF2(PIN, salt, 10k iter) → AES Key → AES-GCM(mnemonic) → Ciphertext
```

### Proposed Architecture (Scrypt + AES)
```typescript
// Enhanced flow:
PIN → Scrypt(PIN, salt, config) → AES Key → AES-GCM(mnemonic) → Ciphertext
```

### Why You Cannot Replace AES with Scrypt

#### 1. **Different Cryptographic Primitives**
- **Scrypt**: Key Derivation Function (not encryption)
- **AES**: Symmetric encryption algorithm
- **Analogy**: Scrypt is like a key factory, AES is like a lock

#### 2. **Output Characteristics**
- **Scrypt**: Fixed output size (32 bytes), deterministic for same inputs
- **AES**: Variable output size, includes authentication tag, requires nonce

#### 3. **Security Properties**
- **Scrypt**: Designed for password hashing, not data encryption
- **AES-GCM**: Provides authenticated encryption with integrity verification

#### 4. **Performance Considerations**
- **Scrypt**: Intentionally slow (100ms+), used once per operation
- **AES**: Extremely fast, suitable for large data encryption

### Refactoring Strategy: Replace PBKDF2, Keep AES

#### Before (Current - Vulnerable)
```typescript
async function encryptWithPin(data: Uint8Array, pin: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  // ❌ Weak: PBKDF2 with static salt
  const key = pbkdf2(sha256, pin, STATIC_SALT, {
    c: 10000,         // Too few iterations
    dkLen: 32
  });

  // ✅ Good: AES-GCM encryption
  const cipher = gcm(key, nonce);
  return cipher.encrypt(data);
}
```

#### After (Proposed - Secure)
```typescript
async function encryptWithPin(data: Uint8Array, pin: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  // ✅ Strong: Scrypt with per-record salt
  const salt = getRandomBytes(16);
  const key = scrypt(pin, salt, {
    N: 32768,         // Cost parameter
    r: 8,             // Block size
    p: 1,             // Parallelization
    dkLen: 32         // Key length
  });

  // ✅ Good: Same AES-GCM encryption
  const cipher = gcm(key, nonce);
  const ciphertext = cipher.encrypt(data);

  // Store salt with ciphertext for decryption
  return concatArrays(salt, nonce, ciphertext);
}
```

### Security Benefits of Scrypt + AES Combination

#### 1. **Defense in Depth**
- **Scrypt**: Prevents brute force attacks on PIN
- **AES-GCM**: Provides data confidentiality and integrity
- **Combined**: Attacker must break both layers

#### 2. **Complementary Strengths**
- **Scrypt**: Memory-hard, GPU-resistant key derivation
- **AES**: Fast, hardware-accelerated data encryption
- **Result**: Secure and performant overall system

#### 3. **Industry Standard Architecture**
```
User Input → KDF (Scrypt) → Encryption Key → Symmetric Cipher (AES) → Protected Data
```
This is the standard pattern used by:
- Password managers (1Password, Bitwarden)
- Disk encryption (LUKS, FileVault)
- Cryptocurrency wallets (hardware and software)

### Alternative Approaches (Not Recommended)

#### Option 1: Scrypt Only (❌ Problematic)
```typescript
// ❌ Misuse of Scrypt for encryption
const encrypted = scrypt(mnemonic + pin + nonce, salt, config);
```

**Problems:**
- Scrypt not designed for encryption
```
**Problems:**
- Argon2 not designed for encryption
- No authentication/integrity verification
- Deterministic output (same input = same output)
- No proper nonce handling

#### Option 2: AES with Better Random Key (❌ Incomplete)
```typescript
// ❌ Strong encryption but weak key protection
const randomKey = getRandomBytes(32);  // Strong key
const encrypted = aesGcmEncrypt(mnemonic, randomKey);
// But how do we securely derive randomKey from PIN?
```
**Problems:**
- Still need KDF to derive key from PIN
- Back to square one with key derivation problem

### Hardware Integration Considerations

#### TEE + Scrypt + AES Architecture
```typescript
// Phase 1: Scrypt key derivation (JavaScript)
const derivedKey = scrypt(pin, salt, config);

// Phase 2: Store derived key in TEE
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('derived_key', base64Key, {
  requireAuthentication: true
});

// Phase 3: AES encryption with TEE-protected key
const protectedKey = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('derived_key', {
  requireAuthentication: true
});
const encrypted = aesGcmEncrypt(mnemonic, base64ToUint8Array(protectedKey));
```

### Implementation Recommendations

#### 1. **Keep AES-GCM for Data Encryption**
- Proven security properties
- Hardware acceleration available
- Industry standard for symmetric encryption
- Authenticated encryption prevents tampering

#### 2. **Replace PBKDF2 with Scrypt for Key Derivation**
- Memory-hard function resists GPU attacks
- Configurable security parameters
- Designed specifically for password-based key derivation
- OWASP recommended standard

#### 3. **Maintain Clear Separation of Concerns**
```typescript
interface CryptoArchitecture {
  keyDerivation: 'scrypt';              // PIN → Key
  dataEncryption: 'aes-256-gcm';    // Key + Data → Ciphertext
  keyProtection: 'tee-hardware';    // Additional key wrapping
  randomGeneration: 'hardware-rng'; // Entropy source
}
```

### Migration Path

#### Step 1: Replace Key Derivation Function
```typescript
// Change only the KDF, keep AES unchanged
- const key = pbkdf2(sha256, pin, STATIC_SALT, {c: 10000, dkLen: 32});
+ const key = scrypt(pin, randomSalt, {N: 32768, r: 8, p: 1, dkLen: 32});
```

#### Step 2: Update Ciphertext Format
```typescript
// New format includes salt and version
const ciphertext = {
  version: 3,
  algorithm: 'scrypt+aes-gcm',
  salt: base64(randomSalt),
  nonce: base64(nonce),
  data: base64(aesGcmCiphertext),
  parameters: {timeCost: 2, memoryCost: 65536, parallelism: 1}
};
```

#### Step 3: Backward Compatibility
```typescript
async function decrypt(ciphertext: string, pin: string) {
  const parsed = JSON.parse(ciphertext);

  if (parsed.version === 1) {
    // Legacy PBKDF2 decryption
    return decryptLegacy(parsed, pin);
  } else if (parsed.version === 3) {
    // New Scrypt decryption
    return decryptScrypt(parsed, pin);
  }
}
```

### Conclusion

**Argon2 and AES are complementary technologies that solve different security problems:**

- **Argon2**: Securely derives strong keys from weak PINs (replaces PBKDF2)
- **AES**: Encrypts data using those strong keys (remains essential)

The refactoring should **replace PBKDF2 with Argon2** while **keeping AES-GCM** for data encryption. This provides the optimal balance of security (memory-hard key derivation) and performance (fast symmetric encryption).

### Current Platform Capabilities Assessment

#### Available TEE Operations (Via Current Dependencies)

**iOS Secure Enclave (via expo-local-authentication + expo-secure-store):**
- ✅ **Key Storage**: Hardware-backed key storage in Secure Enclave
- ✅ **Biometric Gating**: Touch ID/Face ID for key access authorization
- ✅ **Key Generation**: Hardware random number generation in Secure Enclave
- ✅ **Access Control**: Biometric-protected item retrieval
- ❌ **Direct Encryption**: No direct AES operations in Secure Enclave via Expo
- ❌ **Digital Signatures**: No ECDSA/EdDSA operations in Secure Enclave via Expo
- ❌ **Key Derivation**: No PBKDF2/Scrypt operations in Secure Enclave via Expo

**Android TEE (via expo-local-authentication + expo-secure-store):**
- ✅ **Keystore Operations**: Hardware-backed Android Keystore (TEE/StrongBox)
- ✅ **Biometric Gating**: Fingerprint/Face authentication for key access
- ✅ **Key Wrapping**: Hardware-backed key encryption/decryption
- ✅ **Attestation**: Basic key attestation (Android 7+)
- ❌ **Direct Cryptographic Operations**: Limited crypto operations via Expo
- ❌ **Custom Algorithms**: No Scrypt or custom crypto in Android TEE via Expo
- ❌ **Secure Computation**: No arbitrary computation in TEE via Expo

#### Expo SecureStore TEE Integration

**Current Implementation (`expo-secure-store`):**
```typescript
// What's currently possible:
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('key', 'value', {
  requireAuthentication: true,        // ✅ Biometric gate
  authenticationPrompt: 'message',    // ✅ Custom prompt
  keychainService: 'wallet-service'   // ✅ Keychain isolation
});

// Hardware-backed on both platforms:
// iOS: Stored in Secure Enclave-protected Keychain
// Android: Stored in Android Keystore (TEE/StrongBox when available)
```

**Limitations:**
- **No Direct Crypto Operations**: Cannot perform AES/PBKDF2/Scrypt directly in TEE
- **Key Size Limits**: Typically limited to small data (passwords, tokens, small keys)
- **No Custom Algorithms**: Restricted to platform-provided cryptographic operations
- **Limited Attestation**: Basic attestation only, no complex attestation workflows

### Feasible TEE Operations for Each Recommendation

#### 1. Argon2 Key Derivation
**TEE Feasibility: ❌ Not Directly Possible**
- **Current Limitation**: Neither iOS Secure Enclave nor Android TEE expose Argon2 via Expo
- **Workaround**: Store Argon2-derived key in TEE after JavaScript computation
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Phase 1: Argon2 in JavaScript, store result in TEE
  const derivedKey = await argon2id(pin, salt, config); // JS operation
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync('derived_key', base64Key, {
    requireAuthentication: true  // Store in TEE with biometric gate
  });
  ```

#### 2. Hardware Key Wrapping
**TEE Feasibility: ✅ Fully Supported**
- **iOS**: Secure Enclave generates and stores wrapping keys
- **Android**: Android Keystore provides hardware-backed key wrapping
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Generate master key in TEE
  const masterKey = getRandomBytes(32);
  await SecureStore.setItemAsync('master_key', uint8ArrayToBase64(masterKey), {
    requireAuthentication: true,
    authenticationPrompt: 'Authorize key generation'
  });

  // Use master key to wrap data encryption keys
  const dataKey = getRandomBytes(32);
  const wrappedDataKey = await aesGcmEncrypt(dataKey, masterKey);
  ```

#### 3. Biometric Authentication Gating
**TEE Feasibility: ✅ Fully Supported**
- **iOS**: Face ID/Touch ID integration with Secure Enclave
- **Android**: BiometricPrompt with Keystore-backed authentication
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // All sensitive key access requires biometrics
  const sensitiveKey = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('sensitive_key', {
    requireAuthentication: true,
    authenticationPrompt: 'Access wallet encryption key'
  });
  ```

#### 4. Device Binding / Hardware Attestation
**TEE Feasibility: ✅ Partially Supported**
- **iOS**: Hardware-specific key generation (device-bound)
- **Android**: Basic attestation available, StrongBox on newer devices
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Keys generated in TEE are automatically device-bound
  // Cannot be extracted or used on different devices
  const deviceBoundKey = await SecureStore.setItemAsync('device_key', keyData, {
    requireAuthentication: true
  });
  ```

#### 5. Secure Random Generation
**TEE Feasibility: ✅ Fully Supported**
- **iOS**: Secure Enclave provides hardware entropy
- **Android**: TEE/TRNG provides hardware entropy
- **Current Implementation**: Already using `react-native-get-random-values` (hardware-backed)

#### 6. Integrity Verification
**TEE Feasibility: ✅ Partially Supported**
- **iOS**: Can verify key integrity via Keychain item existence/authentication
- **Android**: Key attestation provides some integrity verification
- **Implementation**:
  ```typescript
  // Verify key hasn't been tampered with
  try {
    const key = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('integrity_key', {
      requireAuthentication: true
    });
    return key !== null; // Key exists and passed biometric check
  } catch (error) {
    return false; // Key compromised or device tampered
  }
  ```

#### 7. AES Encryption/Decryption
**TEE Feasibility: ❌ Not Directly Possible via Expo**
- **Current Limitation**: No direct AES operations in TEE via Expo APIs
- **Workaround**: Use TEE for key protection, perform AES in JavaScript
- **Future Enhancement**: Native module could expose platform TEE crypto APIs

#### 8. Digital Signatures
**TEE Feasibility: ❌ Not Directly Possible via Expo**
- **Current Limitation**: No ECDSA/EdDSA operations exposed via Expo
- **Potential**: Could be implemented via native modules for transaction signing

### Recommended TEE Integration Strategy

#### Phase 1: Immediate TEE Utilization (Current Expo Capabilities)
```typescript
// 1. Device Master Key in TEE
const masterKey = getRandomBytes(32);
await SecureStore.setItemAsync('device_master_key', base64Key, {
  requireAuthentication: true,
  authenticationPrompt: 'Initialize wallet security'
});

// 2. Biometric-Gated Key Access
const wrappingKey = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('device_master_key', {
  requireAuthentication: true,
  authenticationPrompt: 'Access wallet encryption'
});

// 3. Hardware-Wrapped Data Keys
const dataKey = getRandomBytes(32);
const wrappedKey = await aesGcmEncrypt(dataKey, base64ToUint8Array(wrappingKey));
const encryptedMnemonic = await aesGcmEncrypt(mnemonic, dataKey);
```

#### Phase 2: Enhanced TEE Operations (Native Module Required)
```typescript
// Future native module interface
interface TeeOperations {
  // Direct encryption in TEE
  encryptInTee(data: Uint8Array, keyId: string): Promise<Uint8Array>;

  // Hardware-backed key derivation
  deriveKeyInTee(password: Uint8Array, salt: Uint8Array): Promise<string>;

  // Digital signatures for transactions
  signInTee(data: Uint8Array, keyId: string): Promise<Uint8Array>;

  // Attestation
  attestKey(keyId: string): Promise<AttestationResult>;
}
```

#### Phase 3: Full TEE Integration (Platform-Specific Implementation)
- **iOS**: Custom Swift module accessing Secure Enclave directly
- **Android**: Custom Kotlin/Java module using Android Keystore provider
- **Operations**: Direct cryptographic operations in hardware

### Implementation Priority for TEE Operations

#### High Priority (Immediately Implementable)
1. **Hardware Key Wrapping** - Use TEE for master key storage and biometric gating
2. **Device Binding** - Generate device-specific keys in TEE
3. **Biometric Authentication** - Gate all sensitive operations with biometrics
4. **Secure Key Storage** - Move critical keys to hardware-backed storage

#### Medium Priority (Native Module Required)
5. **Hardware Random Generation** - Enhanced entropy from TEE (already partially available)
6. **Key Attestation** - Verify key integrity and device state
7. **Direct AES Operations** - Perform encryption/decryption in TEE

#### Low Priority (Complex Platform Integration)
8. **Custom Algorithm Support** - Argon2 or other algorithms in TEE
9. **Transaction Signing** - Hardware-backed digital signatures
10. **Advanced Attestation** - Complex attestation workflows

### Current vs Future TEE Capabilities

#### Immediately Available (Expo APIs)
- ✅ Hardware-backed key storage
- ✅ Biometric authentication gating
- ✅ Device binding
- ✅ Basic integrity verification

#### Requires Native Development
- ❌ Direct cryptographic operations (AES, signatures)
- ❌ Custom algorithms (Argon2)
- ❌ Advanced attestation
- ❌ Secure computation

### Conclusion
While full TEE cryptographic operations require native module development, significant security improvements can be achieved immediately using `expo-local-authentication` and `expo-secure-store`. The recommended approach is to maximize current TEE capabilities for key protection and device binding while planning native modules for direct cryptographic operations.

### Executive Recommendation
**Implement a hybrid approach prioritizing Argon2 with incremental TEE adoption.** This strategy addresses immediate high-severity vulnerabilities while establishing a path toward hardware-backed security.

### Current Context Assessment
- **Platform**: Expo/React Native with limited direct TEE access
- **Dependencies**: `expo-local-authentication` (biometrics), `expo-secure-store` (hardware keychain)
- **Critical Vulnerability**: PBKDF2(10k) allows sub-second brute force of 6-digit PINs
- **Attack Surface**: Offline attacks via device compromise or backup extraction

### Why Argon2 First?

#### Immediate Security Impact
- **GPU Resistance**: Memory-hard function prevents efficient GPU acceleration
- **Configurable Security**: Tunable time/memory costs for future-proofing
- **Cross-Platform**: Native module implementation maintains compatibility
- **Proven Standard**: OWASP recommended for password hashing

#### Implementation Timeline
```
Phase 1 (1-2 sprints): Argon2id implementation
Phase 2 (3-5 sprints): Hardware keystore integration
Phase 3 (Long-term): Full TEE migration
```

### Recommended Argon2 Configuration
```typescript
// Target: ~100ms computation time on target devices
const argon2Config = {
  variant: 'argon2id',    // Hybrid mode (best security)
  timeCost: 2,           // iterations
  memoryCost: 65536,     // 64MB memory usage
  parallelism: 1,        // single thread
  hashLength: 32,        // 256-bit output
  saltLength: 16         // 128-bit salt
};
```

### TEE Integration Strategy

#### Immediate Hardware Utilization
- **Device Binding**: Use hardware keystore to wrap encryption keys
- **Biometric Gating**: Leverage existing `expo-local-authentication`
- **Secure Element**: iOS Secure Enclave / Android Keystore for key operations

#### Incremental TEE Adoption
1. **Key Wrapping**: Hardware-derived Device Encryption Key (DEK)
2. **Integrity Verification**: TEE-backed operation attestation
3. **Full Migration**: Move sensitive operations as platform support matures

### Migration Implementation

#### Phase 1: Argon2 Replacement
```typescript
// Replace current PBKDF2 implementation
async function deriveKeyWithArgon2(
  pin: string,
  salt: Uint8Array
): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  return await argon2id({
    password: stringToUint8Array(pin),
    salt: salt,
    timeCost: 2,
    memoryCost: 65536,
    parallelism: 1,
    hashLength: 32
  });
}
```

#### Phase 2: Hardware Key Wrapping
```typescript
// Wrap data encryption keys with hardware-backed key
async function wrapWithHardwareKey(dataKey: Uint8Array): Promise<Uint8Array> {
  const hwKey = await SecureStore.getItemAsync('device_master_key', {
    requireAuthentication: true,  // Biometric requirement
    authenticationPrompt: 'Authenticate to access wallet'
  });
  return await aesGcmEncrypt(dataKey, base64ToUint8Array(hwKey));
}
```

#### Phase 3: TEE Operations
```typescript
// Platform-specific TEE integration
async function teeVerifyOperation(operation: string): Promise<boolean> {
  if (Platform.OS === 'ios') {
    return await SecureEnclave.verify(operation);
  } else {
    return await AndroidKeystore.verify(operation);
  }
}
```

### Security Impact Analysis

#### Current Risk (PBKDF2)
- **Brute Force Time**: <1 second for 1M PINs with GPU
- **Attack Vector**: Offline via device/backup compromise
- **Success Rate**: 100% given ciphertext + PIN hash

#### Post-Argon2 Risk
- **Brute Force Time**: ~27 hours for 1M PINs (single GPU)
- **Memory Requirement**: 64MB per attempt (limits parallelization)
- **Cost Multiplier**: ~100,000x increase in attack cost

#### Hardware-Backed (Phase 2+)
- **Device Binding**: Offline attacks become infeasible
- **Biometric Fallback**: Additional authentication layer
- **Secure Element**: Hardware-protected key operations

### Platform-Specific Considerations

#### iOS Implementation
- **Secure Enclave**: Hardware-backed key generation/storage
- **Keychain Services**: Biometric-protected item access
- **LocalAuthentication**: Face ID/Touch ID integration

#### Android Implementation
- **Android Keystore**: Hardware-backed key operations
- **BiometricPrompt**: Fingerprint/face authentication
- **StrongBox**: Hardware security module (newer devices)

### Risk Mitigation Timeline

#### Immediate (Argon2)
- ✅ GPU brute force resistance
- ✅ Memory-hard function protection
- ✅ Configurable security parameters
- ✅ Cross-platform compatibility

#### Medium-term (Hardware Integration)
- ✅ Device binding prevents offline attacks
- ✅ Biometric authentication requirements
- ✅ Hardware-protected key operations
- ✅ Secure element utilization

#### Long-term (Full TEE)
- ✅ Complete hardware isolation
- ✅ Attestation-backed operations
- ✅ Side-channel attack resistance
- ✅ Regulatory compliance alignment

### Development Resource Allocation

#### Argon2 Implementation (40% effort)
- Native module integration
- Configuration optimization
- Migration logic for existing data
- Cross-platform testing

#### Hardware Integration (35% effort)
- Keystore API integration
- Biometric authentication flows
- Device capability detection
- Error handling and fallbacks

#### TEE Migration (25% effort)
- Platform-specific TEE APIs
- Operation attestation
- Secure communication channels
- Future-proofing architecture

### Conclusion
Current implementation prevents trivial accidental exposure but is susceptible to decisive offline and automated online brute-force attacks due to low-entropy PIN and static salt. The recommended hybrid approach (Argon2 → Hardware Integration → TEE) provides an optimal balance of immediate security improvement, development feasibility, and long-term strategic positioning. Addressing the highlighted high-severity issues through Argon2 implementation will substantially raise the attack cost by orders of magnitude while establishing a foundation for hardware-backed security evolution.
