I understand your concerns about PIN security in the application. You're right that storing PINs in JavaScript string variables can create security risks, especially when they're passed between components.

Let's redesign the PIN handling to use inversion of control (IoC) with a more secure approach. This way, the PIN component handles PIN collection, validation, and immediate processing without unnecessary storage or passing to parent components.

Solution Steps:
Create a new secure PIN processor utility that handles PIN operations with minimal exposure
Refactor the PinInputModal to use IoC pattern where it accepts PIN operation callbacks
Update the PinInputField to clear PINs immediately after use
Modify PIN handling in parent components to provide operation callbacks
Implement memory clearing for sensitive data
